As we've seen in the introduction, our equations works with two major vector fields: the electrical field $\vec E$ and
the Magnetic Field $\vec B$. Because we're using these vector fields, we need to use new mathematical tools to solve
our equations.
# Differential Calculus of Vector Fields
## Reminder: Vector Algebra
If you have followed any basic mathematical or physics class, you should already know what I'm gonna talk about, but
just in case you forgot I'm gonna talk about the algebra of vectors. A vector is a geometric object defined by a
magnitude (also called length) and a direction. We can perform on them different mathematical operations, like we do
with numbers with the addition and the multiplication. Let's define a vector called $\vec v$ and a real number a.

### Vector negation, addition and soustraction
We can negate our vector by just inverting the direction. Then we can add together multiple vectors, the result is just
a vector starting from the origin of vector a and going to the end of the path formed by our vectors.

### Scalar multiplication
We can multiply our vector by a scalar, here and in the following articles a scalar is just a real number, i.e.
$a\in\mathbb{R}$. The result of this operation is just a vector having its magnitude multiplied by our scalar, i.e. the
new magnitude is equal to $a\times||\vec v||$/

### Dot product
There is two way to make the product of two vectors, the first one is the dot product, written $$\vec u\cdot\vec v$$.
It is defined by:
$$
    \vec u\cdot\vec v=||\vec u||||\vec v||\cos\theta
$$
This product uses the angle between our two vectors ($\theta$), if the vectors have the same direction, then $\theta=0$
and $\cos\theta=1$ and our dot product is only the product of the magnitude. If the vectors have opposite directions,
then $\theta=\pi=180°$ and $\cos\theta=-1$, so our dot product is the negated magnitude product. You can also note that
if our vectors are perpendicular (i.e. $\theta=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}=\pm90°$) then our dot product is null, meaning this
operation can be a great tool to find if two vectors are perpendicular or not. The result of this product is a scalar
(a real number in our case). We can also use this equation to find the dot product:
$$
    \vec u\cdot\vec v=u_xv_x+u_yv_y+u_zv_z
$$

### Cross product
This product is only useful when working on a 3 dimensional space. It is defined the following way (but this equation
is not used often):
$$
    \vec u\wedge\vec v=||\vec u||||\vec v||\sin(\theta)\vec n
$$
We can see that, contrary to the dot product, the result isn't a scalar but another vector. We're also using a vector
called $\vec n$, this is the normal vector: a unit vector perpendicular to both a and b and with a direction defined by
the right hand rule (we're gonna talk about this rule later). The sinus makes our product behave at the opposite of the
dot product on the special angles: when the vectors have the same or opposite direction the dot product is the null
vector and if they are perpendicular then the magnitude of the product is just and b magnitudes product. The resulting
vector can also be found using:
$$
    \vec u\wedge\vec v=\begin{pmatrix}
        u_x\\
        u_y\\
        u_z\\
    \end{pmatrix}\wedge\begin{pmatrix}
        v_x\\
        v_y\\
        v_z\\
    \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
        u_yv_z-u_zv_y\\
        u_zv_x-u_xv_z\\
        u_xv_y-u_yv_x\\
    \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Vector Field Calculus
We're gonna talk about three different operators used to permorm differential calculus on vector fields.
> Multiple notations exists for these operators, I will wrote all of them the first time but after I'll only use the
> $\vec\nabla$ operator.

Let's define a vector field called $\vec A$ defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ by:
$$
    \vec A=\begin{pmatrix}A_x\\A_y\\A_z\end{pmatrix};\quad(A_x, A_y, A_z)\in\mathbb{R}^3
$$

### Divergence
The divergence is the first operator we'll see, it's the simplest of them all, it's just the vector field having for
coordinates the derivative of the initial vector field coordinates:
$$
\vec{\text{div}}\vec A=\vec\nabla\vec A=\nabla\vec A=\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}\\
\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial y}\\
\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial z}\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Gradient
The gradient is similar to the divergence, the difference is that instead of having a vector field as a result we have a
scalar. We're just summing together the derivative of the coordinates, like this:
$$
\vec{\text{grad}}\vec A=\vec\nabla\cdot\vec A=\nabla\cdot\vec A=\frac{\partial A_x}{\partial x}
+\frac{\partial A_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial z}
$$
