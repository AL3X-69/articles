# Electromagnetism: Introduction
Today we talk about a huge chunk of Physics: the Electromagnetism. You may already have heard this term as the EMR
(Electromagnetic Radiation) is responsible of a lot of things in our universe, and so in our everyday lives.
In this series of articles, I'm gonna explain everything you have to know about this subject and we will even solve some
exercises together! Maybe you are an experienced physics student or just someone curious, anyway these articles are for
you and I will try to be beginner friendly.

## Blibliography
I used my knowledge to write these articles, but I also used some books that I highly recommend you to check out if you
want to dig deeper:
- [Feynman Lectures about Electromagnetism](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_01.html) (**These notes are an incredible work and the basis of all my articles on the subject**)

> Note to my english readers: Because I'm french, I've read the french versions of these books, things may differ
between the two versions

I also used the notes I've taken from my university classes, so I want to thank the Pr. P. Kleimann (PhD),
Pr. S.M. Perisanu (PhD) and Pr. T. Biben (PhD) from the Claude Bernard University of Lyon for their work on the classes
I've participated (UEs GEP1000E and PHY2016L).

## An analogy to start our journey
If you've done a little bit of physics or astronomy, you should already know the gravitational force,
the force that keep our feet on the ground and make the Earth spin around the Sun. This force is defined by:
$$
    \vec{F_{A/B}}=G\frac{m_Am_B}{d^2}\vec{u}
$$
With $F_{A/B}$ being the force applied on the object B by object A in Newtons (N), G the gravitational constant in
Newtons times square metres per square kilograms ($N.m^2.kg^{-2}$), $m_A$ and $m_B$, respectively, the mass of object A
and object B in kilograms (kg), d the distance between A and B and finally $\vec u$ the unit vector, having for origin B
for magnitude 1 and going from B to A. We can represent of all these on a schematic:

As we can see on the equation, if we double the distance the force is divided by four because of the square. But in
order of this force to work, we need objects with huge mass like a planet or a star, this force does not apply to
object of our scale. So you may ask yourselves "But what holds atoms together to form matter?",
because gravitational force is weak we'll see that another force, very similar to the gravitational force but much
stronger takes place on much smaller entities: This "strong" force is the Electric Force. Although theses forces are very similar, there a few differences.

First this new force, unlike gravity, can be attractive or repulsive and it depends of the physical nature of our objects,
because we are now considering the polarity of our entities: the electric charge. And we can observe the following behavior: two object with the same polarity
repulse themselves and two objects with different polarity attract themselves. The electrical charge is often named q and
mesured in Coulombs (C). We define this new force with this equation, also called the Coulomb's law:
$$
    \vec{F_e}=\frac{q_Aq_B}{4\pi\varepsilon_0d^2}\vec u
$$
As we can see, if we compare it to the gravitational equation, the mass has been replaced by $q_a$ and $q_b$,
the two electrical charges of our entities A and B. You'll also notice a new constant $\varepsilon_0$, this one is
called the vacuum permittivity and is mesured in Farad per meters ($F.m^{-1}$). This constant is only valid in the
vacuum, meaning our equation only works in the vacuum. More precisely, this law isn't very useful because its limited
to the interaction between two simple charges in the vacuum. But don't worry we'll see in the next articles more ways to
find how complex charge interact together.

## The General Principle of Electromagnetism
By experimenting, we found that the force, on a given charge, acts differently depending on its position in space and its
speed and only these parameters applied to this specific charge. Meaning that this force is independant of other charges
floating around. So we can define our force in another way:
$$
    \vec F = q(\vec E+\vec v\wedge\vec B)
$$

We see here two new variables we never encountered before: $\vec E$ and $\vec B$. These variables are vector fields, the
first one is the Electrical Field and the second is the Magnetic Field. These two fields are the basis of all the other
equations we'll see next, so fasten your seatbelt, because we're gonna study the Electrical Field in the following
article: Electrostatics Part 1.
