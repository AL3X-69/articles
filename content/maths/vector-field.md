# Vector Fields: An explanation and the basic toolbox to work with it

## What is a Vector Field ?
A vector field is a function that associate any point of an euclidean space ($\R^n$) to a vector.

__But what does it mean ?__ Imagine you are studying the altitude of a location on a map, this map contain a beach (we take the water level as reference for the altitude, TLDR: sea level = 0m) as well as a mountain, the highest point on our map.

How can you represent, mathematically speaking, the altitude of any point on your map ? Vector field are the solution:
you take any point on a map and it's associated vector represent the altitude.
This trick gives you access to a bunch of new mathematical tools to work with your vector field, for example to find the direction of the mountain, the highest point of our map which is therefore the vector with the highest norm.

You can see on this image multiples examples of representation of vector fields. 
These fields are useful in physics, when you study the speed of a system at any point of a space or when studying electromagnetism for example.

# The vector field toolbox
In the following examples, I will use two vector fields:
- One in an n-dimensional Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^n$), defined by:

$$
f=\begin{pmatrix}
    f_a\\
    f_b\\
    ...\\
    f_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$

- One in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^3$), defined by

$$
C=\begin{pmatrix}
    C_x\\
    C_y\\
    C_z
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## The gradient
The gradient of a vector field is also a vector field, it's the vector field which has for coordinates the result of the partial derivatives of the coordinates of the original vector space.
From the mathematician's point of view: A linear application $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and its gradient $\vec\nabla f: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ at a point $p=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ is defined by:

$$
\vec{\text{grad}} f=\vec\nabla f =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(p)\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(p)\\
...\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(p)\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So in summary, as we can see in the preceding equation, the gradient is the partial derivative of the vector field coordinate to coordinate.

From a technical point of view, the gradient is useful to find the points with the highest variation, because that's what derivative do, they study the variation of a function.
As an example, we will imagine a room where the temperature is given by a scalar field defined on a 3-dimensional Euclidean space ($\mathbb R^3$), so that at each point the temperature is the result of $T(x,y,z)$. The gradient will show the direction where the temperature is rising the most quickly and the magnitude of the gradient will be the intensity of the variation.

## The divergence
The divergence of a vector field is a scalar, the physical representation of this operator is more complex than the gradient.
This operator returns a real, showing if the vector field at this point is behaving more like as a "source" or as a "sink".

![Result of the divergence depending of the behavior of the vector field](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Divergence_%28captions%29.svg/500px-Divergence_%28captions%29.svg.png)

On a 3-dimensional space, like $\R^3$, the divergence formula is

$$\vec{\text{div}}C=\vec\nabla\cdot C=\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial C_z}{\partial z}$$

You can see that the result of this equation is a scalar and not a vector field like the gradient or the curl.
You will also notice this equation is very similar to the one we use for the gradient, the only difference is you need to sum the coordinates after.

## The curl
The curl of a vector field is a vector field, the physical representation is a vector field describing the infinitesimal circulation.
It's a really complex operator, and it's hard to visualize it physically.
It is defined, on an n-dimensional Euclidean space ($\R^n$) and on a point $p=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ by

$$
\vec\nabla\wedge f=\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}\\
...\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\\
\end{pmatrix}\wedge\begin{pmatrix}
f_{x_1}\\
f_{x_2}\\
...\\
f_{x_n}\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

So in a 3-Dimensional space:

$$
\vec\nabla\wedge C=\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\\
\end{pmatrix}\wedge\begin{pmatrix}
    C_x\\
    C_y\\
    C_z
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{\partial C_z}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial z}\\
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial C_z}{\partial x}\\
    \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial y}\\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Relations between these operators
$$
\vec\nabla\wedge(\vec\nabla\vec C)=0\\
\vec\nabla\cdot(\vec\nabla\wedge\vec C)=0\\
\vec\nabla\wedge(\vec\nabla\wedge\vec C)=\vec\nabla(\vec\nabla\cdot\vec C)-\Delta\vec C
$$
